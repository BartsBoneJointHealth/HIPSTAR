# shiny app code

This code is used to visualise the results from:

- [1_database_summary](https://github.com/BartsBoneJointHealth/HIPSTAR/tree/main/1_database_summary)

- [2_analysis](https://github.com/BartsBoneJointHealth/HIPSTAR/tree/main/2_analysis)

To launch the shiny add the results in the data folder. You can add them
as .csv or .zip files, and combine multiple database results.

> [!WARNING]
>
> DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILES. Only results starting with
> `cdm_summary_...`, `patient_demographics_...`,
> `large_Scale_characteristics_...` (`1_database_summary`); and
> `results_` (`2_analysis`) files will be considered.
